##### Design

###### Fonts

The Montserrat and Raleway fonts are used for an easily readable, light and modern, feel. 

###### Colours

The colour palette is simply dark-grey and white, with a little blue thrown in for links.

###### Features

The site-name "Spotlight" is displayed in the top-left; to the right is the navigation bar which collapses to a hamburger menu for smaller devices. A search input box is provided to the top right.

The main feature is provided using a Jumbotron, displaying a banner image, accompanying Call to Action text and a link to the main content; two minor features are tucked underneath using Card Posts, showing small images and text for secondary Call to Action items.

###### Responsive

Being Bootstrap based, the template is fully responsive and will resize to fit smaller screens automatically.

##### Dependencies

All of Bootstrap's default dependencies are included. 

Although only the Grid, Navigation, Dropdown and Collapse are used.  

To reduce  the overall dependency footprint consider using the associated Spotlight Webpack Starter Kit to rebuild the template with your preferred mix of dependencies.

The kit is available as a separate repository for those who wish to optimise or configure the template using the `npm run build-optimise` option.
