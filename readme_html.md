##### Design Notes

The Montserrat and Raleway fonts have been paired to create an easily readable, light and modern, blog.

The template displays a site-name "Spotlight", a navigation bar, and search input at the top; followed by a jumbotron feature post and two minor card posts; a list of older posts links is provided to the right hand-side.

As a Bootstrap based, the template is fully responsive and will resize to fit smaller screens; including the menu, which will collapse for mobile devices.

##### Bootstrap Dependencies

Bootstrap's full default jQuery and Popper dependencies are included. These allow, amongst other things, for the menu's dropdown to work. To reduce or reduce the overall dependency footprint consider using the associated Spotlight Webpack Starter Kit to rebuild the template with your preferred mix of dependencies.

##### Webpack Starter Kit

This repository contains the HTML and CSS produced by the Spotlight Webpack Starter Kit using the `npm run build-template` option.

The kit is available as a separate repository for those who wish to optimise or configure the template further using the `npm run build-optimise` option.

##### Roadmap

No future enhancements are planned for this template.

However, a version of the template is planned for Google Blogger and potentially WordPress and Umbraco too. Enhancements made during those development activities may be applied to this project.

##### Contributions

Feature suggestions, enhancements, pull requests or other contributions are all welcome.
