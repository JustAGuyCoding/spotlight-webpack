##### Design 

###### Fonts

The Montserrat and Raleway fonts have been paired to create an easily readable, light and modern, blog.

###### Features

The template displays a site-name "Spotlight", a navigation bar, and search input at the top; followed by a jumbotron feature post and two minor card posts; a list of older posts links is provided to the right hand-side.

###### Responsive

As a Bootstrap based, the template is fully responsive and will resize to fit smaller screens; including the menu, which will collapse for mobile devices.

##### Installation

After downloading the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/JustAGuyCoding/spotlight.git
npm init
```

Then to build a static html template:

```
npm run build-template
```

Or to build an optimised template:

```
npm run build-optimise
```

The generated template will be copied to the `/dist` folder.

##### Bootstrap Dependencies

Bootstrap's full default jQuery and Popper dependencies are included. These allow, amongst other things, for the menu's dropdown to work. To reduce or reduce the overall dependency footprint consider using the associated Spotlight Webpack Starter Kit to rebuild the template with your preferred mix of dependencies.

##### Roadmap

No future enhancements are planned for this template.

However, a version of the template is planned for Google Blogger and potentially WordPress and Umbraco too. Enhancements made during those development activities may be applied to this project.

##### Contributions

Feature suggestions, enhancements, pull requests or other contributions are all welcome.
